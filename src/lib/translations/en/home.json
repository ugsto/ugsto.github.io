I'm Andr√©.<br /><br />If you're here, it's probably because you want to know a bit more about me, so here goes: My passion for computing started very early, but I can say that my real start in the field was when I began in robotics through the 'Construindo o Futuro Hoje' (CFH) project.<br /><br />It was with this opportunity that I fell in love with low-level programming and robotics. In fact, it was during this time that I achieved one of my proudest accomplishments: A workshop at Campus Party Brasilia 2019 on the topic of Wearables.<br /><br />In 2021, I completed my integrated high school at IFPR, a course integrated with a technical course in computing. In this course, we had a TCC (Course Conclusion Work) discipline, and from there comes the second achievement I'm most proud of: A co-authored publication on the Traveling Salesman Problem through Latinoware.<br /><br />Near the end of my course, I entered the tech market as a developer at PROOFSEC, and since then, I have been refining my technical skills as a programmer and related areas.<br /><br />Apart from that, I am an enthusiast for open-source projects, a proponent of skeptical thinking, and a philosophy enthusiast.
