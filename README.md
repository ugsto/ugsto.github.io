[![Deploy static content to Pages](https://github.com/ugsto/ugsto.github.io/actions/workflows/static.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ugsto/ugsto.github.io/actions/workflows/static.yml)

Welcome to my portfolio! This site is my personal web page. Visit the portfolio at: ![www.bortoli.phd](https://www.bortoli.phd)

## Run this site

To run this site locally, it is as simple as running a svelte application:

### Development mode

First you install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

As this application relies on wasm modules, it has a simplified Makefile to facilitate the deployment.

```bash
make
```

After runnin this command, the static website will be available in the directory `dist`.
