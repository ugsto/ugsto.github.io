	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
	<span class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</span>

	<p class="text-slate-11 mb-4">
		Iâ€™m AndrÃ© Augusto Bortoli, a logical thinker fascinated by the "why" behind everyday phenomena.
		My passion for the scientific method and a skeptical mindset guide my approach to tackling
		problems and absorbing new knowledge.
	</p>

	<p class="text-slate-11 mb-4">
		Currently, I'm studying Systems Analysis at the Federal Institute of ParanÃ¡. Once I complete
		this course, my plan is to embark on a master's degree, continuing my academic journey.
	</p>

	<p class="text-slate-11 mb-4">
		My coding adventure started in childhood creating silly games on Scratch. I soon advanced to
		Arduino during a robotics project and then progressed to C++ and C. My exploration of various
		programming languages eventually brought me to web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		In high school, I honed my skills in Python, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript. It was during this
		period that I encountered Rust, which quickly rose to become my language of choice.
	</p>

	<p class="text-slate-11 mb-4">
		I've been a full-time Software Engineer for two years at a cybersecurity company. In this role,
		beyond coding, I've had the opportunity to delve into infrastructure configurations, IaC,
		Kubernetes, and cloud technologies, applying my coding skills in innovative and challenging
		ways.
	</p>

	<p class="text-slate-11">
		When not engaged in coding for work or study, I'm often found playing chess, exploring
		philosophical ideas, or coding for sheer enjoyment.
