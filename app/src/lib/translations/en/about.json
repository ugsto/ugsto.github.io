	"greeting": "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹",
	"content": "Currently, I'm studying Systems Analysis at the Federal Institute of ParanÃ¡. Once I complete this course, my plan is to embark on a master's degree, continuing my academic journey.\nMy coding adventure started in childhood creating silly games on Scratch. I soon advanced to Arduino during a robotics project and then progressed to C++ and C. My exploration of various programming languages eventually brought me to web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In high school, I honed my skills in Python, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript. It was during this period that I encountered Rust, which quickly rose to become my language of choice.\nI've been a full-time Software Engineer for two years at a cybersecurity company. In this role, beyond coding, I've had the opportunity to delve into infrastructure configurations, IaC, Kubernetes, and cloud technologies, applying my coding skills in innovative and challenging ways.\nWhen not engaged in coding for work or study, I'm often found playing chess, exploring philosophical ideas, or coding for sheer enjoyment."
